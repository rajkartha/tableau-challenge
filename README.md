For this homework I did a comparison of Jersey City (JC), NJ and New York City (NYC) bike share data from 2019 month of June.  New York City definitely had a lot more bike share users than Jersey City

The following analysis was done
- Popular Starting locations  - In this analysis the popular JC starting locations were near train stations, whereas in NYC they were more generic.

- Popular Ending locations - Similar story as starting locations

- Popular Start times - Obviously the peak hours were morning and evening prior to and after office hours.  Similar findings for both cities.

- Average users by Age - In both cases, 50 year old people used more bike shares in the cities.  Which is strikingly coincidential.  NYC had 220K users and JC had 3.5K users of the same age.

- Median age by Gender - Similar story here.  Females were in the group of 30-35 and Males were in the 35 or higher group

I created three dashboard per city and made a story view for just NYC.
